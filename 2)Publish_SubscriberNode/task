Timer 
https://roboticsbackend.com/roscpp-timer-with-ros-publish-data-at-a-fixed-rate/

Create class containing 2 subscribers and 1 publisher

In the same file of class.cpp create main function and spin() there

When you create a class, you also need to create header file .h




publisher node 2つ
Node1: publishes outputs booltype( random )
Node2: publishes random positive integer (from 1 to 10: random)

Subscirber 一つ
Node3: subscribes topic from Node4 and prints it to the console.


Node4
Subscribes: Topics from Node1 and Node2 and store these values. ( The only current values are needed to be stored i.e. it does not have to store all the value received by the publisher)
publishes (at fixed rate of time) the integer value determined as follows;
    ·if the most currently subscribed bool value is true, then multiply the most currently subscribed integer value by 2.
    ·if the most currently subscribed bool value is false, then negate the most currently subscribed integer value.
Note: Use ros::Timer to publish the topic at fixed rate.
